## haspburg-llm

Haspburg llm is a built from scratch nano gpt modification which iteratively trains on its own output

to give you a frame of reference this is what 5 generations of training does to haspburg-llm

note: these models were trained for a 5-10 mins on an intel i7
to realise the full capability and breakdown of the llm i'd recommend running this on a single 8XA100 40GB node in about 4 days of training per generation
(DONT DO IT, MASSIVE WASTE OF RESOURCES)
this project was done for fun, not for practical implementation

ANGELO:
And cowards it be strawn to my bed,
And thrust the gates of my threats,
Because he that ale away, and hang'd
An one with him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank your eyes against it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Then will answer him to save the malm:
And what have you tyrannous shall do this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If you have done evils of all disposition
To end his power, the day of thrust for a common men
That I leave, to fight with over-liking
Hasting in a roseman.
